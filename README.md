### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I am Kymarndo, or Steven. Welcome to my GitHub!

I have had previous experiences within software, with languages such as C#, python, and JavaScript. Cloud services with Google (Firebase), Microsoft Azure. Also with Mongodb. I am currently studying with Mission Ready to revise and improve my skillset as well as get exposure to languages and technologies not previously touched. My favorite so far would be creating React projects.

I've also had some tinkering with Android Studio for mobile apps, Unity and Unreal Engine for game development.

My path going forward is not only to develop skills for a career in Full Stack Development, Mobile or Game Development. But to enjoy this as a hobby and experiment with many passion projects. Software Development challenges me mentally yet at the same time I enjoy it to where it doesn't feel like work!
